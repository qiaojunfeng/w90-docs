- Input Files:

    - `graphene.scf` *The `pw.x` input file for ground state calculation*

    - `graphene.bands` *The `pw.x` input file for band structure
        calculation*

    - `graphene.bandsx` *The `bands.x` input file for extracting band
        structure eigenvalues*

    - `graphene.projwfc` *The `projwfc.x` input file for
        projectability calculation*

    - `graphene.plotband` *The `plotband.x` input file for plotting
        band structure*

    - `graphene.nscf` *The `pw.x` input file to obtain Bloch states on a
        uniform grid*

    - `graphene.pw2wan` *Input file for `pw2wannier90.x`*

    - `graphene.win` *The `wannier90.x` input file*

## Steps

1. Run `pw.x` to obtain the ground state of graphene

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pw.x < graphene.scf > scf.out
    ```

2. Run `pw.x` to obtain the band structure of graphene

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pw.x < graphene.bands > bands.out
    ```

3. Run `projwfc.x` to obtain the band structure projectability of graphene

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    projwfc.x < graphene.projwfc > projwfc.out
    ```

4. Run `bands.x` to obtain a `graphene.bands.dat` file containing the
    band structure of graphene

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    bands.x < graphene.bandsx > bandsx.out
    ```

5. Run `plotband.x` to plot the band structure with projectability for
    graphene
    (note: run `plotband.x` interactively to see the meaning of each
    line in the input file)

    1. First rename file so that it can be recognized by `plotband.x`

        ```bash title="Terminal"
        mv graphene.bands.dat.proj.projwfc_up graphene.bands.dat.proj
        ```

    2. Run `plotband.x`

        ```bash title="Terminal"
        plotband.x < graphene.plotband > plotband.out
        ```

    3. Generate a `graphene.projbands.gnu_projected.ps` file

        ```bash title="Terminal"
        gnuplot graphene.projbands.gnu
        ```

    4. Generate a `graphene.projbands.gnu_projected.pdf` file, see
        Fig. [graphene_projbands](#fig:graphene_projbands)

        ```bash title="Terminal"
        ps2pdf graphene.projbands.gnu_projected.ps
        ```

6. Run `pw.x` to obtain the Bloch states on a uniform k-point grid

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pw.x < graphene.nscf > nscf.out
    ```

7. Run `pw.x` to generate a list of the required overlaps (written into the
    `graphene.nnkp` file).
    (note: see `win` input file, no need to specify initial projections,
    they are automatically chosen from the pseudo-atomic orbitals inside
    pseudopotentials used in the scf calculation)

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    wannier90.x -pp graphene
    ```

8. Run `pw2wannier90.x` to compute the overlap between Bloch states and
    the projections for the starting guess (written in the
    `graphene.mmn` and `graphene.amn` files).

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pw2wannier90.x < graphene.pw2wan > pw2wan.out
    ```

9. Run  to compute the MLWFs.

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    wannier90.x graphene
    ```

10. Run `gnuplot` to compare DFT and Wannier-interpolated bands, this
    will generate a PDF file `graphene_bandsdiff.pdf`, see
    Fig. [graphene_bandsdiff](#fig:graphene_bandsdiff).

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    ./graphene_bandsdiff.gnu
    ```

    Notice that high-projectability states in the conduction region are
    properly reproduced. Try commenting out the
    `dis_froz_proj, dis_proj_max/min` lines in the `win` input file, and
    use the energy disentanglement `dis_froz_max/min`, and compare the
    band interpolations.

11. (Optional) Clean up all output files

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    make clean
    ```
